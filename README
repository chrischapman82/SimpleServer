A simple server using TCP, implementing HTTP 1.0 that I created in C for a uni project.
 
Run to create a simple server on a local machine.

Is on the simple side, taking GET requests and outputting codes 200 OK and 404 NOT OK. 
Can deal with HTML, JPEG, CSS and JS files.
 
Takes arguments: portnumber  -> The Port number to put the server on
                 root path   -> The root dir for finding objects
